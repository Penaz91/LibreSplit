## Installation

- Arch-based Distros
    - `yay libresplit-git`
    - `paru libresplit-git`

    See the [libresplit-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libresplit-git) package on the Arch User Repository (AUR).

- NixOS

    See the [libresplit](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=25.05&show=libresplit&query=libresplit) package, courtesy of [@fgaz](https://github.com/fgaz).

## Building

LibreSplit requires the following dependencies on your system to compile:

- `git`
- `meson`
- `libgtk+-3.0`
- `x11`
- `libjansson`
- `luajit`

Install the required dependencies:

- Debian-based systems

    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential libgtk3-dev libjansson-dev meson luajit
    ```

- Arch-based systems

    ```sh
    sudo pacman -Sy
    sudo pacman -S gtk3 jansson luajit git meson
    ```

Clone the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LibreSplit/LibreSplit
cd LibreSplit
```

Now compile and install:

```sh
meson setup build -Dbuildtype=release
meson compile -C build
meson install -C build
```

All done! Now you can start the desktop **LibreSplit** or run `/usr/local/bin/libresplit`.

---

## Usage

When you start **LibreSplit** for the first time, it will create the `libresplit` directory in your config directory (it will usually be `~/.config/libresplit`). Such directory will contain:

- Splits.
- Auto Splitters.
- Themes.

All 3 directories will start empty, so you may want to download the [resource repository](https://github.com/LibreSplit/LibreSplit-resources/) first and clone it in `~/.config/libresplit/` before starting LibreSplit for the first time.

A file dialog will then appear, asking you to select a Split JSON file (see [Split files](#split-files)).

Initially the window is undecorated. You can toggle window decorations by pressing the `Right Control` key.

### Default Keybinds

The timer is controlled with the following keys
(note that their action **depends on the state of the timer**):

| Key                   | Timer is Stopped   | Timer is running   |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| <kbd>Spacebar</kbd>   | Start timer        | Split              |
| <kbd>Backspace</kbd>  | Reset timer        | Stop timer         |
| <kbd>Delete</kbd>     | Cancel             | -                  |

Cancel will **reset the timer** and **decrement the attempt counter**. A run that is reset before the start delay is automatically cancelled.

If you forget to split, or accidentally split twice, you can manually change the current split:

| Key                  | Action     |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| <kbd>Page Up</kbd>   | Unsplit    |
| <kbd>Page Down</kbd> | Skip Split |

### Colors

The color of a time or delta has a special meaning.

| Color         | Meaning                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Dark red      | Behind splits in PB and losing time      |
| Light red     | Behind splits in PB and gaining time     |
| Dark green    | Ahead of splits in PB and gaining time   |
| Light green   | Ahead of splits in PB and losing time    |
| Blue          | Best split time in any run               |
| Gold          | Best segment time in any run             |

## FAQ

- **How do I resize the application window?**

    You can edit the `width` and `height` properties in the [Split JSON File](docs/split-files.md)

- **How do I change the default keybinds?**

    You can change the keybinds using the `gsettings` command.

    See [Settings and Keybinds](docs/settings-keybinds.md) for some examples and more information.

- **How do I make the keybinds global?**

    You can set the `global-hotkeys` property as `true` using `gsettings`. See [Settings and Keybinds](docs/settings-keybinds.md).

    Wayland users experienced crashes when enabled `global-hotkeys`, so this settings is ignored for Wayland desktops. We are working towards a way to bring global hotkeys to everyone.

- **Can I modify LibreSplit's appearance?**

    Yes. You can [create your own theme](docs/themes.md) or [download themes online](https://github.com/LibreSplit/LibreSplit-resources/tree/main/themes).

- **How can I make my own split file?**

    You can use any existing JSON split file as an example from our [resource repository](https://github.com/LibreSplit/LibreSplit-resources/tree/main/splits) and refer to the [Split Files Documentation](docs/split-files.md) for more information.

    You can place the split files wherever you prefer, just open them when starting LibreSplit.

- **Can I define custom icons for my splits?**

    Yes! You can use local files or web urls. See the `icon` key in the [split object](docs/split-files.md#split-object).

    The default icon size is 20x20px, but you can change it like so:

    ```css
    .split-icon {
        min-width: 24px;
        min-height: 24px;
        background-size: 24px;
    }
    ```

- **Can I contribute?**

    Absolutely!

    You can contribute in many ways:

    - By making [pull requests](https://github.com/LibreSplit/LibreSplit/pulls).
    - By creating new themes, split files or auto splitters and add them to our [resource repository](https://github.com/LibreSplit/LibreSplit-resources/).
    - By [reporting issues](https://github.com/LibreSplit/LibreSplit/pulls).
