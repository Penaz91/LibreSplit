# Themes

LibreSplit can be customized using themes, which are made of CSS stylesheets.

## Changing the theme

You can set the global theme by changing the `theme` value using `gsettings`.

```sh
gsettings set com.github.wins1ey.libresplit theme <theme-name>
```

Also each split JSON file can apply their own themes by specifying a `theme` key in the main object, see [the split files documentation](split-files.md) for more information.

## Creating your own theme

1. Create a CSS stylesheet with your desired styles.
2. Place the stylesheet under the `~/.config/libresplit/themes/<name>/<name>.css`directory where `name` is the name of your theme. If you have your `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` env var pointing somewhere else, you may need to change the directory accordingly.
3. Theme variants should follow the pattern `<name>-<variant>.css`.

See the [GtkCssProvider documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/css-properties.html) for a list of supported CSS properties. Note that you can also modify the default font-family.

If a split has a `title` key, its UI element receives a class name derived from its title.

Specifically, the title is lowercase and all non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with hyphens, and the result is concatenated with `split-title-`.

For instance, if your split is titled "First split", it can be styled by targeting the CSS class `.split-title-first-split`.
